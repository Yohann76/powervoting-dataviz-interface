# Roadmap for this tool 

## V1.0

- Here is the situation (position out of range, have a favorable boost...) with the old code, we need to find a way to validate that this is no longer the case using a new chart on the analysis page.

## V2.0

- Integrate balance-calcultator into a generated page (before upload) to use and configure balance-calcalculator settings and test them.
    - blocking: Balance-calculator requires choices to be made at yarn start, which makes things a little more complex.

- Add the DAO colors to this interface
