# Roadmap for this tool 

- Add the snapshot file history to the upload page, ready to be clicked and analyzed (on the analysis page), with each time a difference in the number of holders, number of wallets in the pools, and total power voting numbe

- Integrate balance-calcultator into a generated page (before upload) to use and configure balance-calcalculator settings and test them.
    - blocking: Balance-calculator requires choices to be made at yarn start, which makes things a little more complex.

- Add the DAO colors to this interface
